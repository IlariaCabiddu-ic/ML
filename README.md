## Image restoration
This project explains how an autoencoder works and how it can be used to implement an image restoration tool. 

The aim of this project is to recover an image from a degraded version, usually a blurred and noisy image. Image restoration is the operation of taking a corrupt/noisy image and estimating the clean, original image. 

The prime objective of restoration is to reconstruct an image, that has been degraded, based on some prior knowledge regarding the phenomena of degradation of the images.
The intention of restoration is to abolish noise or damage which all degrade quality of a picture. Degradation comes in many forms and, for example, it may be caused by phoenomena of: tear, blur, noise, missing of camera focus, or scratches.
